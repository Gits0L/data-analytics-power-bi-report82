### 1. Project information 
---
This project entails the development of a comprehensive report consisting of the following pages:

| Page | Contents |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Exective Summary | Company performance overview detailing outcomes against key targets  |
| Customer Info |  Customer information page detailing customer count by revenue and location metrics  | 
| Product Detail | Product information outline showing success of product sales by product and region |
| Stores Map | Map visual showing regional profit performance by quarter  |
| Stores Drillthough | Allows drillthough to particular store within region |

### 2. Function 
---
The function of this project is to utulise the skills learnt in the PowerBi module of the aicore datascience course to build a data visualisation mimicking real retail data. By leveraging the company's business objectives, including sales metrics on a quarterly and annual basis, the report aims to deliver actionable insights to guide the company's future strategic direction. The report provides a succinct business overview created for C-suite executives within a global retail corporation. 
 

### 3. Milestones:
 #### The project is split into milestones each containing various tasks to complete the visualisation.
---

***Milestone 1:
Importing Tables***
 
 | Table | Importing Method | Transformations | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Orders | Azure SQL Database  | Renamed and split columns. Deleted private columns. Removed empty date values. |
| Products |  CSV download  | Split weights and measurments into 2 seperate columns. Converted values to decimals. Converted values to kg. Deleted unimportant columns |
| Stores | Azure BLob Storage | Renamed columns |
| Customers | Combined from zip file  | Created Full Name column. Deleted unused columns. Renamed columns  |

***Milestone 2:
Model Creation***

![alt text](PICTURE OF MODEL)
1. Created a date table to form the basis for time intelligence within the model using the folllowing DAX formula: 
Dates = DATESBETWEEN(
    Orders[Order Date],
    MIN(Orders[Order Date]),
    MAX(Orders[Order Date])
)

1. Built one-to-many relationships with a single filter between the following tables to form a star-based schema: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders[product_code] &rarr; Products[product_code]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders[Store Code] &rarr; Stores[store code]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders[User ID] &rarr; Customers[User UUID]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders[Order Date] &rarr; Date[date]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders[Shipping Date] &rarr; Date[date]

3. Created DAX Formulas for the following measures: 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Orders: 
COUNT(Orders[User ID]) 

 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Revenue: 
SUMX(Orders, Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price]))

 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Profit: 
SUMX(Orders, (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost])) * Orders[Product Quantity])

 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Customers: 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(DISTINCT(
        VALUES(Orders[User ID])
    )
)
)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Quantity: 
SUM(Orders[Product Quantity])

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profit YTD:  
CALCULATE([Total Profit], FILTER(ALL('Dates'), VALUE('Dates'[Year]) = (YEAR(MAX('Dates'[Order Date])))))


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue YTD:
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    FILTER(
        ALL('Dates'),
        VALUE('Dates'[Year]) = YEAR(MAX('Dates'[Order Date]))
    )
)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue per Customer:
[Total Revenue] * [Total Unique Customers]

4. Created date hierachy
![alt text](PICTURE)

5. Created a calculated column to create a full country name: 
  

6. Created a geography column with the following DAX formula:
DAX

7. Created a geography hierarchy
